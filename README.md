Jun 27 2022

To create a password generator that accepts user input to generate a password. When the user accesses the application they will be prompted to input the following:
 
 1. the number of characters used (between 8 to 128)
 2. Choice to use lowercase letters
 3. Choice to use uppercase letters
 4. Choice to use numbers
 5. Choice to use symbols

 Following the verification of these choices a random password will be returned as long as one choice of character type has been confirmed.

 To start the generator click the generate button:

 Clicking OK will confirm that you would like to add the listed characters.  When a user cancels it will instead not use the character type referenced.

 The randomized password will appear in the "Your Secure Password field as seen below:

 Research was completed via google searches, mdn, youtube, and many many tears.
